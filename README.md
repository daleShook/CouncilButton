# The Council Button: Chrome Extension

The Council Button is a lightweight Chrome extension built to demonstrate how AI-assisted tools can amplify clarity, structure, and decision-making. It serves as a gateway to *The Council GPT*, a symbolic cognition framework designed for focused project management and Autojournal workflows.

This extension was developed from concept to working prototype in three days as part of an exploration into lightweight, browser-native tools that integrate directly with generative AI systems. It also serves as a springboard for integrating front-end tools with cognitive frameworks like The Council GPT.
