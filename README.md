# The Council Button: Chrome Extension

The Council Button is a lightweight Chrome extension built to demonstrate how AI-assisted tools can amplify clarity, structure, and decision-making. It serves as a gateway to *The Council GPT*, a symbolic cognition framework designed for focused project management and Autojournal workflows.

This project was developed from concept to working prototype in three days as part of an exploration into lightweight, browser-native tools that integrate directly with generative AI systems.

## Why This Project

Modern workflows are often cluttered with noise. The Council Button simplifies access to structured thinking by embedding AI-assisted reasoning directly into the browser.

This extension reflects a strong focus on:
- Building tools that map to how people think and plan
- Rapid prototyping to prove out technical fluency and product vision
- Designing for clarity and purpose with minimal cognitive overhead

## Features
- Quick Access: Instantly opens The Council GPT for structured reasoning and project clarity
- Autojournal Integration: Hooks into backend journaling workflows for seamless progress tracking
- Clean, Minimal UI: Designed for fast focus without distractions

## Built With
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla)
- Chrome Extensions API (Manifest v3)
- *The Council GPT* backend integration for AI-assisted workflows

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository as a ZIP file.
2. In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable “Developer Mode” (top right).
4. Click “Load Unpacked” and select the unzipped project folder.

## What This Shows

This project highlights:
- Full-stack fluency from front-end UI to backend GPT integrations
- Execution speed, moving from concept to working prototype in 72 hours
- A documentation mindset that makes the artifact stand alone as a proof of skill
- Human-centered design aimed at building tools that reflect thinking workflows, not just technical specs

## Next Steps
- Enhanced UI customization
- Interactive overlays for real-time project insights
- API integrations to extend The Council Button’s capabilities
